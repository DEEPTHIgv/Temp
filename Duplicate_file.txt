		Version Control System

Version Control System is also called Revision Control System or Source Code 
Management.
It is system of  storing projects (repositories) online along with histrory of every 
change made. Multiple people can pull the project to their personal systems and
work on the repository simultaniously and update the changes on the online 
platform. If some some changes were made to the repository by another colaborator 
by the time then the VCS does not let the changes get updated and asks the user to 
pull the collaborator's updates first and then update one's changes. This makes it the 
best platform to collaborate.
Another big advantage of  VCS is one can edit a repository without disturbing the 
main repository till the the editing is complete by branching the repository. Multiple 
branches can be made at a time.
GIT is an example of  VCS. Since it is open sourced, other's work can be used as the 
basis of one's work.
